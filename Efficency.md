### EFFICENCY
#### Use the least amount of resources to achieve the highest amount of output 


### COMPLEXITY
#### complexity = cost
#### worst case scenario 
#### Always go for the highest order number

### Usage of resouces:
#####  - Memory allocation
#####  - Number of comparisons

### BUBBLE SORT
#### Doesn't matter how much faster you can make bubble sort the complexity is still N^2 because N^2 * 1 or (N^2) / 2 is still N^2
#### Space complexity is N(1) 

### Space Complexity
#### Becareful with recursion
