#### Stack and Heap

8 bits = 1 byte ( Represent number from 0 -256 ) 

You can look at the memory in term of hex in CLION and the convert it to binary online.

Stack is a small memory dedicated for the code running 

Stack is how much money you making 

Heap is the bank where you can borrow memory from 

int data [1024]; // 4* 1024

Stack is roughly 8mb

memory address is 16bit 

All your function in the same program share the same amount of memory of 8mb in the stack 

Recursion can run of the stack memory if it goes too long 

#### Linux 
unlimit -s : show you how much memory is in your stack 

#### C++
#define PrintX to replace 

Foo is not the pointer
Cat is a type 
Cat * is also a type

If you want to use it like this you should use the heap for it to be accessible outside of the scope
